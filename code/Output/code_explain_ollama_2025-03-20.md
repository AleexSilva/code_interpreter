**Original Code**
```python
yield from {book.get("author") for book in books if book.get("author")}
```
**Explanation**

This code is a generator expression that yields the values of the "author" key in each dictionary item (`book`) of the `books` iterable.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

* `{...}`: This denotes an ordered dictionary comprehension, similar to a list comprehension but for dictionaries.
* `book.get("author")`: For each dictionary item `book`, this expression retrieves the value associated with the key "author". The `.get()` method returns `None` if the key is not present in the dictionary.
* `for book in books`: This iterates over the `books` iterable, assigning each dictionary to the variable `book`.
* `if book.get("author")`: For each dictionary, this filter clause ensures that only dictionaries with a non-None "author" value are considered.

The `yield from` syntax introduces this generator expression as a child iterator of another iterator (presumably generated by some other code). The result is an asynchronous stream of authors, where each author is yielded when the `get()` method is called on a dictionary that meets the condition.

**Use Case**

This code might be used in a scenario where you have a list of books, and you want to process or yield only the authors associated with those books. For example:
```python
books = [{"title": "Book1", "author": "Author1"}, {"title": "Book2", None}]
async def get_authors():
    return yield from {book.get("author") for book in books if book.get("author"}

for author in get_authors():
    print(author)  # Prints: Author1 and then None
```
**Code Improvement**

While the code is concise, it can be improved by making it more explicit about its intention.

```python
def get_authors(books):
    return {book["author"] for book in books if isinstance(book.get("author"), str)}
```
Changes:

* Made the function signature more specific (`books` parameter).
* Used a regular list comprehension instead of an ordered dictionary comprehension.
* Simplified the `if` condition to check if the value is a non-empty string (assuming "author" is always a string key).

This revised implementation does exactly the same thing as the original code but with improved readability and robustness.
